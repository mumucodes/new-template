            A gender neutral or gender inclusive pronoun is a pronoun which does not associate a gender with the individual who is being discussed.
            <hr />
            Some languages, such as English, do not have a gender neutral or third gender pronoun available, and this has been criticized, since in many instances, writers, speakers, etc. use “he/his” when referring to a generic individual in the third person. Also, the dichotomy of “he and she” in English does not leave room for other gender identities, which is a source of frustration to the transgender and gender queer communities.
            <hr />
            People who are limited by languages which do not include gender neutral pronouns have attempted to create them, in the interest of greater equality. You can’t always know what someone’spronouns are by looking at them.Asking and correctly using someone’spronouns is one of the most basic waysto show your respect for their genderidentity.
            <hr />
            When someone is referred to with the wrong pronoun, it can make them feel disrespected, invalidated, dismissed, alienated, or dysphoric ( often all of the above.)

            It is a privilege to not have to worry about which pronoun someone is going to use for you based on how they perceive your gender. If you have this privilege, yet fail to respect someone else’s gender identity, it is not only disrespectful and hurtful, but also oppressive. She/her/hers and he/him/his are a fewcommonly used pronouns. Some peoplecall these “female/feminine” and “malemasculine” pronouns, but many avoidthese labels because not everyone whouses he feels like a “male” or“masculine.
            
            There are also lots of gender-neutral pronouns in use. Here are a few you might hear: They/them/theirs (Shea ate their foodbecause they were hungry.) This is apretty common gender-neutral pronounand it can be used in the singular. Infact, “they” was voted as the Word ofthe Year in 2015. Ze/hir/hir (Tyler ate hir food becauseze was hungry.) Ze is pronounced like“zee” can also be spelled zie or xe,and replaces she/he/they. Hir ispronounced like “here” and replacesher/hers/him/his/they/theirs. Just my name please! (Ash ate Ash’sfood because Ash was hungry) Somepeople prefer not to use pronouns atall, using their name as a pronouninstead. Never refer to a person as “it” or“he-she”. These are offensive slursused against trans and gendernon-conforming individuals</div>
